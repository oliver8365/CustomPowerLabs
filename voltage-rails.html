            <h2 id="overview" class="anchor-target">What Are Voltage Rails?</h2>
            <p>Voltage rails are the lifeblood of your electronics—dedicated power lines delivering the precise voltages your components need to thrive. And at CustomPowerLabs, we’re obsessed with making them *yours*. We’re talking **multiple voltage rails**, each one crafted in whatever configuration you desire—boost, buck, or a dazzling mix of both—to satisfy your every power whim. Whether it’s 3.3V for a delicate sensor, 12V for a beefy motor, or anything in between, we’ll design as many rails as you need, in any boost or buck setup you can dream up, all tailored to your unique project. No cookie-cutter solutions here—just pure, customized power brilliance.</p>

            <h2 id="configurations" class="anchor-target">Multiple Voltage Rails in Any Configuration You Want</h2>
            <p>Here’s where we flex our customization muscles—hard. At CustomPowerLabs, we don’t just offer voltage rails; we offer **multiple voltage rails** in every imaginable boost or buck configuration, meticulously tailored to your exact needs. Want more rails? Different voltages? A wild combo of boosts and bucks? We’ll make it happen, and we’ll make it sing. Let’s break it down:</p>
            
            <h3>Multiple Boost Rails: Skyrocketing Your Power</h3>
            <p>Need to crank up the voltage for multiple parts of your system? Our **multiple boost rail configurations** are your golden ticket. We can design as many boost rails as you want—2, 5, 10, you name it—each one stepping up voltage with surgical precision to meet your components’ demands. From high-voltage LEDs to power-hungry amplifiers, we’ll tailor every rail to your exact specs, ensuring efficiency, stability, and pure power perfection. Tell us what you need, and we’ll boost it into the stratosphere—customized just for you.</p>
            
            <h3>Multiple Buck Rails: Precision Power, Scaled Down</h3>
            <p>Got components that need a lighter touch? Our **multiple buck rail solutions** deliver as many step-down rails as your heart desires, each one dialed in to the perfect voltage for your system. Whether it’s one buck rail or a dozen, we’ll craft them all in any configuration you like, slashing voltage with finesse and efficiency to keep your devices humming happily. Microcontrollers, sensors, low-power circuits—you dream it, we buck it, all tailored to your every specification.</p>

            <h3>Mixed Boost-Buck Rails: The Ultimate Customization Party</h3>
            <p>Why choose when you can have it all? Our **mixed boost-buck rail configurations** let you throw multiple boost *and* buck rails into the same design—however many you want, in whatever combo you crave. Need three boost rails at 12V, two buck rails at 5V, and a bonus rail at 3.3V? Done. Want positive and negative rails in the mix? No sweat. We’ll weave together as many voltage rails as your project demands, boosting here, bucking there, all customized to fit your system like a glove. This isn’t just power—it’s a masterpiece of flexibility, built to your exact vision.</p>
            <p>And here’s the kicker: there’s no limit to how many rails we can provide or how we configure them. Multiple boost rails? Multiple buck rails? A dazzling mix of both? We’ll keep adding rails and tweaking configurations until your power setup is exactly—*exactly*—what you need. At CustomPowerLabs, customization isn’t an option; it’s our whole game.</p>

                <h3>Buck Converters (Step-Down)</h3>
                <p>A <strong>buck converter</strong>, also known as a <strong>step-down converter</strong>, reduces a higher input voltage to a lower output voltage. These converters are widely used in <strong>battery-operated devices</strong>, <strong>microcontrollers</strong>, and <strong>power-sensitive electronics</strong>, where efficient power regulation is essential.</p>
                
                <h4>How a Buck Converter Works:</h4>
                <p>It operates using <strong>switching regulation</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Switching ON:</strong> The input voltage is applied across an inductor, storing energy in its magnetic field.</li>
                    <li><strong>Switching OFF:</strong> The inductor releases stored energy to the output capacitor, supplying power at a lower voltage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Mechanism:</strong> A <strong>pulse-width modulation (PWM) controller</strong> adjusts the duty cycle to maintain a steady output voltage.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Advantages of Buck Converters:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Highly Efficient</strong> – Typically above 90% efficiency, minimizing energy waste.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compact & Lightweight</strong> – Ideal for portable electronics like smartphones, tablets, and laptops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Battery-Friendly</strong> – Ensures stable power to sensitive components, extending battery life.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h4>Common Applications:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smartphones & Tablets: Ensures stable 5V power for charging circuits.</li>
                    <li>Embedded Systems & Microcontrollers: Converts 12V or 24V down to 3.3V or 5V.</li>
                    <li>Electric Vehicles: Powers infotainment and low-voltage systems from a high-voltage battery pack.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Boost Converters (Step-Up)</h3>
                <p>A <strong>boost converter</strong>, or <strong>step-up converter</strong>, does the opposite of a buck converter—it increases a lower input voltage to a higher output voltage. This is critical for low-power sources like solar panels or single-cell batteries that need to power higher-voltage components.</p>
                
                <h4>How a Boost Converter Works:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Switching ON:</strong> The inductor stores energy from the input power source.</li>
                    <li><strong>Switching OFF:</strong> The stored energy is released, combining with the input to create a higher voltage at the output.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Circuitry:</strong> The PWM controller adjusts the switching frequency to regulate the output voltage.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h4>Advantages of Boost Converters:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Power Utilization</strong> – Enables low-voltage sources to power high-voltage devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compact and Lightweight</strong> – Used in solar, automotive, and battery-operated systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improves Battery Performance</strong> – Effectively draws power from low-voltage batteries.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h4>Common Applications:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Solar Power Systems: Converts low 3-12V DC solar outputs into usable higher voltages.</li>
                    <li>Automotive LED Lighting: Steps up 12V car battery power for LED arrays.</li>
                    <li>Portable Power Banks: Boosts 3.7V lithium battery power to charge 5V USB devices.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Buck-Boost Converters</h3>
                <p>A <strong>buck-boost converter</strong> combines the capabilities of both buck and boost converters, allowing it to step up or step down voltage as required. This makes it ideal for systems where the input voltage fluctuates above and below the desired output voltage.</p>
            
                <h4>How a Buck-Boost Converter Works:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Utilizes a <strong>single inductor</strong> and <strong>switching MOSFET</strong> to store and release energy.</li>
                    <li>Can operate in either <strong>buck mode (step-down)</strong> or <strong>boost mode (step-up)</strong> depending on input voltage conditions.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h4>Advantages of Buck-Boost Converters:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Handles Wide Input Voltage Ranges</strong> – Works even when the power source varies significantly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compact & Efficient</strong> – A single circuit provides both voltage increase and reduction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliable Power Regulation</strong> – Ideal for battery-powered and automotive systems.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h4>Common Applications:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Electric Vehicles: Regulates fluctuating battery power for multiple systems.</li>
                    <li>Laptop Power Adapters: Accepts various input voltages and outputs a stable 19V for charging.</li>
                    <li>Wearable & Medical Devices: Ensures constant voltage operation despite battery drain.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Isolated DC-DC Converters</h3>
                <p>An <strong>isolated DC-DC converter</strong> differs from other types because it electrically separates the input and output circuits. Using a <strong>transformer or optocoupler</strong>, this type of converter is crucial for high-voltage applications, industrial automation, and medical equipment, where safety and EMI reduction are key concerns.</p>
            
                <h4>How an Isolated DC-DC Converter Works:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Input power is converted to AC using a high-frequency switching circuit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> AC power is transferred across a transformer, ensuring electrical isolation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Output rectification converts AC back into a stable DC voltage for the load.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h4>Advantages of Isolated Converters:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Safety</strong> – Protects against ground loops and high-voltage faults.</li>
                    <li><strong>Superior Noise Immunity</strong> – Reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI).</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliable Performance in Harsh Environments</strong> – Used in industrial, aerospace, and medical applications.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h4>Common Applications:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Medical Equipment: Powering MRI, X-ray, and patient monitoring devices.</li>
                    <li>Industrial Automation: High-voltage machine control systems requiring isolation.</li>
                    <li>Aerospace & Defense: Ensures safety in avionics and satellite communications.</li>

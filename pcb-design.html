            <h2 id="overview" class="anchor-target">PCB Design That Breaks the Mold</h2>
            <p>At CustomPowerLabs, we don’t do “one-size-fits-all”—we do **one-size-fits-YOU**. PCB design isn’t just about slapping components on a board; it’s about crafting a masterpiece that fits your project like a glove, no matter how crazy your requirements get. We’re talking **fully custom sizing**, **topologic structures** that defy the norm, and **double-stacking PCBs** to squeeze every ounce of functionality into the tightest spaces. If you can dream it, we can build it—because when it comes to flexibility and customization, we’re the undisputed champs.</p>
            <p>We thrive on the challenge of making the impossible possible. Need a PCB that’s 12.7 mm wide to slide into a bespoke enclosure? We’ve got it. Want a board that twists, bends, or stacks to fit a microscopic footprint? We’re already sketching it out. Our obsession with customization means there’s no limit to what we can do—your vision drives us, and our flexibility delivers.</p>

            <h2 id="flexibility" class="anchor-target">Our Superpower: Unmatched Flexibility</h2>
            <p>Flexibility isn’t just a buzzword for us—it’s our entire game plan. Forget rigid templates or boring standards; we’re here to stretch, shrink, twist, and stack your PCB until it’s *exactly* what you need. **Fully custom sizing requirements?** We don’t blink at odd dimensions or quirky shapes—square, circular, triangular, or something straight out of a sci-fi novel, we’ll make it happen. No minimums, no “sorry, that’s not possible”—just pure, unadulterated customization tailored to your specs.</p>
            <p>And when we say we’re customizable, we mean it down to the tiniest detail. Need a PCB that fits into a space so tight it makes a sardine can look roomy? We’ll whip out our **double-stacking magic**, layering boards vertically to pack twice the punch in half the footprint. Got a wild idea for a **topologic structure** that bends around corners or folds into 3D perfection? We’re the wizards who’ll bring it to life, routing traces with precision and creativity that’ll make your head spin. At CustomPowerLabs, “custom” isn’t just a promise—it’s our obsession, and we’ll bend over backward (and maybe sideways too) to prove it.</p>

            <h2 id="features" class="anchor-target">Features That Redefine What’s Possible</h2>
            <h3>Fully Custom Sizing: Your Dimensions, Your Rules</h3>
            <p>Standard PCBs are for the uninspired. We specialize in **fully custom sizing requirements**, meaning your board can be as big, small, wide, narrow, or weirdly shaped as your project demands. Need a 5 cm x 2 cm rectangle for a sleek wearable? Done. A 17 mm circular board for a tiny sensor? Easy. We don’t care if it’s a fraction of a millimeter off the norm—we’ll cut it, shape it, and perfect it to slide into your design like it was meant to be there all along. No constraints, no compromises—just flexibility that fits.</p>
            
            <h3>Topologic Structures: Engineering Meets Artistry</h3>
            <p>Why stick to flat and boring when you can go bold? Our **topologic structures** take PCB design to the next level, offering layouts that laugh at convention. We’re talking flexible sections that bend around obstacles, rigid-flex hybrids that adapt to 3D spaces, and creative trace routing that maximizes every millimeter. Need a board that wraps around a curve or folds into a tight nook? We’ll engineer it with precision so stunning, it’s practically art. Customization here isn’t just about function—it’s about pushing boundaries and making your PCB a standout.</p>

            <h3>Double-Stacking PCBs: Twice the Power, Half the Space</h3>
            <p>When your size constraints are tighter than a drum, we pull out the big guns: **double-stacking PCBs**. This genius move layers two (or more!) boards vertically, connected seamlessly to double your functionality without hogging more real estate. It’s like building a high-rise in a cramped city lot—perfect for compact gadgets like IoT devices, medical implants, or aerospace tech. We design every stack with thermal flow, signal clarity, and assembly ease in mind, so you get a tiny powerhouse that performs like a giant. Tight spaces? We laugh in their face.</p>

            <h2 id="applications" class="anchor-target">Where Our Flexibility Shines</h2>

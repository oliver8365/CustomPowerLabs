            <h2 id="overview" class="anchor-target">PCB Design That Breaks the Mold</h2>
            <p>At CustomPowerLabs, we don’t believe in <strong>one-size-fits-all</strong> solutions—we engineer <strong>one-size-fits-YOU</strong> designs. PCB design isn’t just about placing components on a board; it’s about crafting a tailored solution that integrates seamlessly into your project, no matter how unconventional the requirements. Whether you need <strong>fully custom sizing</strong>, <strong>complex topologic structures</strong>, or <strong>double-stacked PCBs</strong> to maximise functionality in ultra-compact spaces, we deliver designs that push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p> 
            <p>We thrive on solving challenges that other manufacturers might shy away from. Need a PCB precisely <strong>12.7 mm wide</strong> to fit within a bespoke enclosure? Consider it done. Looking for a board that <strong>twists, bends, or integrates into an intricate 3D assembly</strong>? We’re already mapping out the layout. Our commitment to customisation ensures that no dimension, shape, or configuration is off-limits—if you can conceptualise it, we can engineer it.</p>
            <p>Beyond just form factor, we optimise every aspect of our designs for <strong>efficiency, durability, and performance</strong>. Whether it’s a high-density PCB for a cutting-edge wearable, a thermally managed layout for industrial automation, or a multi-layered powerhouse for aerospace applications, we tailor every detail to your specific needs. At CustomPowerLabs, <strong>customisation isn’t just an option—it’s our specialty</strong>. We don’t settle for ordinary, and neither should you.</p>
            
            <h2 id="flexibility" class="anchor-target">Our Superpower: Unmatched Flexibility</h2>
            <p>At CustomPowerLabs, flexibility isn’t just a feature—it’s the foundation of everything we do. Standard PCB templates and restrictive design limitations don’t belong in our vocabulary. Instead, we engineer solutions that <strong>stretch, shrink, bend, and stack</strong> to fit your exact requirements. Whether your project calls for <strong>unconventional dimensions, intricate layouts, or multi-layered stack-ups</strong>, we’ll tailor a PCB design that integrates flawlessly into your system. No minimum orders, no “that’s not possible”—just precision engineering shaped entirely around your needs.</p>            
            <p>We specialise in creating PCBs that adapt to the most challenging constraints. Need a custom-sized board that fits within <strong>millimetre-tight tolerances</strong>? We’ll get it right the first time. Working with <strong>curved, flexible, or multi-plane enclosures</strong>? We’ll design a rigid-flex hybrid that conforms effortlessly to your form factor. Our <strong>double-stacking technology</strong> allows us to layer PCBs vertically, maximising functionality while maintaining a compact footprint—perfect for applications where space is at an absolute premium.</p>            
            <p>Beyond size and structure, we refine every detail to <strong>optimise electrical performance, thermal management, and mechanical integrity</strong>. Whether you need a board with <strong>intricate trace routing</strong> to minimise signal loss or a <strong>high-density component layout</strong> for mission-critical applications, our expertise ensures you get a PCB that doesn’t just fit—it excels. At CustomPowerLabs, <strong>customisation isn’t an afterthought—it’s our speciality</strong>. Whatever your vision, we’ll turn it into reality with engineering precision and uncompromising flexibility.</p>
            
            <h2 id="features" class="anchor-target">Features That Redefine What’s Possible</h2>
            <h3>Fully Custom Sizing: Precision Without Limits</h3>
            <p>When it comes to PCB design, standard sizes and shapes often force engineers to compromise. At CustomPowerLabs, we eliminate those restrictions by offering <strong>fully custom sizing</strong>, ensuring that your board conforms precisely to your project’s requirements. Whether you need a <strong>5 cm × 2 cm ultra-thin rectangle</strong> for a sleek wearable, a <strong>17 mm circular board</strong> for a compact sensor, or an irregularly shaped design to fit a unique enclosure, we make it happen with millimetre-perfect precision.</p>
            
            <p>Our custom-cut PCBs don’t just fit—they integrate <strong>seamlessly</strong> into your hardware, reducing unnecessary bulk and maximising efficiency. No arbitrary constraints, no design compromises—just <strong>pure adaptability</strong> tailored to your project’s needs. Whether you’re working on a prototype or scaling to mass production, we deliver boards that <strong>align with your vision down to the last detail</strong>.</p>
            
            <h3>Topologic Structures: Engineering That Pushes Boundaries</h3>
            <p>PCBs don’t have to be flat, boring slabs. At CustomPowerLabs, we specialise in <strong>advanced topologic structures</strong> that redefine conventional circuit board design. Our expertise allows us to create <strong>rigid-flex hybrids</strong>, intricate layouts with <strong>multi-dimensional routing</strong>, and <strong>bendable, foldable PCBs</strong> that adapt to complex enclosures and unconventional form factors.</p>
            
            <p>Whether you need a PCB that <strong>wraps around corners</strong>, <strong>folds into tight enclosures</strong>, or <strong>integrates seamlessly into 3D assemblies</strong>, we’ll engineer it with the precision needed for flawless operation. Every trace is routed with optimal efficiency, ensuring <strong>signal integrity, EMI mitigation, and mechanical durability</strong>. Our designs don’t just function—they become a structural and electrical advantage within your system.</p>

            <h3>Double-Stacking PCBs: More Power, Less Space</h3>
            <p>When compact designs demand maximum functionality, our <strong>double-stacking PCB technology</strong> delivers. By vertically layering multiple PCBs, we enable designs that <strong>double processing power, expand I/O capabilities, and enhance signal integrity</strong> without increasing footprint size. This technique is a game-changer for <strong>IoT devices, aerospace applications, high-density medical electronics, and next-generation computing modules</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>Our double-stacked PCBs are engineered with <strong>thermal dissipation, EMI shielding, and structural integrity</strong> in mind. We ensure that stacked layers remain <strong>electrically efficient, mechanically robust, and production-ready</strong>. If your design is pushing the limits of space constraints, this technique allows you to <strong>pack more functionality into less volume</strong>—without sacrificing performance or reliability.</p>
